                About 20 years. Thats how long I have worked as a nurse in the hospital by night.
                There have been ups and there have been downs. From the beginning as a novice learning the trade,
                To big anticlimax that was the global pandemic. I've pushed myself through one of the toughest further education
                there is for a nurse in sweden and became an specialist nurse in anesthesia 2016.

                Always awake when everybody else was asleep. Butchering my own social-life in the progress. 
                Now I've come to the conclusion that I need something else in my life. Seeing as I've always 
                had an interest and passion for programming and computer in general, the choice was easy. 
                So in january of 2023 I wrote my very first "Hello World"! 
            </p>

            <p>
                From that point everything started to move very fast. I had to provide eligibility for most of the 
                educations I had in mind, so the very first step was to enroll in an pre eligibility class for adults. 
                I hadn't even gotten my grades when the big eligibility tests for the actual code Academy came around.
                To actual pass the exams and get admitted did'nt feel as an possibility for me at the time.
                But Lo and behold, I did!

               So back to the school life for me it was! Having 4 years of university studies in the back I do have some experience in how to study.
               But what dont have is programming experience. As I said earlier I wrote my first "Hello World" about 4 months before I got in at Yrgo school. 
               Lucky me, that I have fell in love with programming. Safe to say that Im doing my best to try and level the playing field sort of say. I spend almost all my 
               waking hours at the computer either programming or watching tutorials. I dont even see it as a choir, I love it and choose it over playing video games! I cant wait for
               getting to write "real" programs and websites for real customers!

              In my spare time I love the outdoors! I take every chance I get to go out in the woods, camping and fishing or just hiking.
              I have a little companion in the form of my dog Billy Bob Thornton. If I could I would also take my cats, but always
              they dont enjoy the outdoors as much as I do!

              I live with my beautiful wife and 2 daughters. We try to travel and see the world as often as we can. 
              unfortunately the kids are growing and doesn't seem to want to spend as much time with their old parents as they
              used to do.

              I very much enjoy my Sage barista master. Its an manuel espresso brewer that brews a perfect espresso. It
              takes a bit of training, but the journey was well worth it as Im now enjoying café quality coffee every day!

              Other than that, it isn't really much left to tell you about myself. I play videogames, I love football (änglarna),
              and enjoy the family life! Hopefully well get to know one another soon enough when you hire me!
