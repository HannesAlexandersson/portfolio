                About 20 years. Thats how long I have worked as a nurse in the hospital by night.
                There have been ups and there have been downs. From the beginning as a novice learning the trade,
                To big anticlimax that was the global pandemic. I've pushed myself through one of the toughest further education
                there is for a nurse in sweden and became an specialist nurse in anesthesia 2016.

                Always awake when everybody else was asleep. Butchering my own social-life in the progress. 
                Now I've come to the conclusion that I need something else in my life. Seeing as I've always 
                had an interest and passion for programming and computer in general, the choice was easy. 
                So in january of 2023 I wrote my very first "Hello World"!

                From that point everything started to move very fast. I had to provide eligibility for most of the 
                educations I had in mind, so the very first step was to enroll in an pre eligibility class for adults. 
                I hadn't even gotten my grades when the big eligibility tests for the actual code Academy came around.
                To actual pass the exams and get admitted did'nt feel as an possibility for me at the time.
                But Lo and behold, I did!

               So back to the school life for me it was! Having 4 years of university studies in the back I do have some experience in how to study.
               But what dont have is programming experience. As I said earlier I wrote my first "Hello World" about 4 months before I got in at Yrgo school. 
               Lucky me, that I have fell in love with programming. Safe to say that Im doing my best to try and level the playing field sort of say. I spend almost all my 
               waking hours at the computer either programming or watching tutorials. I dont even see it as a choir, I love it and choose it over playing video games! I cant wait for
               getting to write "real" programs and websites for real customers!
