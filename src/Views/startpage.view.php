        <p>Yrgopelago was a project we had over christmas 2023. It was a contest among the students of the class, where we each made a fictive hotel in the  fictive archopelago of Yrgopelago. We then all got 100 dollars each wich we could then spend on eachothers hotels. The student who had the most money on the end of the day won! </p>

        <p>Retronautica was a project in the course Digital Design where we was supposed to create a website for our own dream cinema. Me and my project partner Liv both love fantasy and science fiction, so ofcourse we made a science fiction cinema who only plays old classics! It contains a landing page and a event page for 2000 A space odyseeÂ´</p>
